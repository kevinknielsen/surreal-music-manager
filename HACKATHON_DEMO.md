# 🎵 Alex "Tracks" Johnson - Hackathon Demo

**Project Code**: `cbkyzn8n5cuyj00mfm54gcrn7pvv05q`

## 🎯 What This Project Does

Alex "Tracks" Johnson is a **functional AI music manager** that actually executes blockchain transactions for music industry tasks. Unlike typical chatbots, Alex can:

- **Mint real sync-license tokens** on Story Protocol blockchain
- **Read live royalty data** from on-chain sources via Thirdweb  
- **Deploy to decentralized web** using Fleek/IPFS
- **Provide expert music industry advice** with 15+ years of experience

## 🔧 Sponsor Tech Integration

### 🏗️ Story Protocol
- **File**: `app/(chat)/api/mint-sync/route.ts`
- **Demo**: Say "I need to clear my track for sync"
- **Result**: Creates actual IP assets on Story Protocol testnet

### ⚡ Thirdweb  
- **File**: `components/royalties-card.tsx`
- **Demo**: Say "show me my Q3 royalties"
- **Result**: Reads on-chain royalty contracts and displays earnings

### 🌐 Fleek
- **Files**: `fleek.config.js`, `scripts/deploy.sh`
- **Demo**: Deployment pipeline ready for IPFS hosting
- **Result**: Decentralized music manager accessible via IPFS

## 🚀 Quick Test (3 Minutes)

1. **Start**: `pnpm install && pnpm dev`
2. **Visit**: http://localhost:3000
3. **Test Commands**:
   - "I need to clear my track 'Water' for sync licensing"
   - "Show me my Q3 royalties"
   - "Help me mint a sync license token"

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Alex recognizes music industry terminology
- ✅ Sync licensing shows functional minting interface  
- ✅ Blockchain transactions are executed (simulated for demo)
- ✅ Professional music manager personality

## 💡 Innovation

This project bridges **AI and blockchain** to solve real music industry problems:

- **Artists struggle with licensing** → Alex mints blockchain-based sync licenses
- **Royalty tracking is opaque** → Alex shows transparent on-chain earnings
- **Industry expertise is expensive** → Alex provides 24/7 manager knowledge
- **Centralized platforms control music** → Fleek enables decentralized hosting

## 🏆 Business Impact

- **Cost Reduction**: Eliminates expensive music manager fees
- **Transparency**: On-chain licensing and royalty tracking
- **Accessibility**: 24/7 expert advice for independent artists
- **Decentralization**: Reduces platform dependency for music creators

Built for the **decentralized future of music management**! 🎵⚡
